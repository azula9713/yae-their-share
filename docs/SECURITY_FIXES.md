# Sync Engine Security Fixes and Updates

## üîí Security Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Insecure `get` Query**

- **Issue**: The `get` query in `convex/splits.ts` was fetching ALL splits from the database regardless of user permissions
- **Fix**: Completely removed the insecure query since `getSplitsByUserId` already handles user-specific data properly

### 2. **Fixed `getSplitById` Access Control**

- **Issue**: `getSplitById` allowed access to any split without proper permission checks
- **Fix**: Updated to implement proper access control:
  - ‚úÖ **Public splits**: Accessible by anyone (no authentication required)
  - ‚úÖ **Private splits**: Only accessible by the creator (authentication required)

### 3. **Added Authentication to All Mutations**

- **Issue**: `createSplit`, `updateSplit`, and `deleteSplit` had no authentication checks
- **Fix**: Added proper authentication and authorization:
  - All mutations now require authentication
  - Users can only create/modify/delete their own splits
  - Proper user validation for all operations

## üîÑ Sync Engine Updates

### 4. **Fixed Sync Engine to Use Secure Queries**

- **Issue**: Sync engine was calling the removed `api.splits.get` query
- **Fix**: Updated to use `api.splits.getSplitsByUserId` with proper user context

### 5. **Added User Context Management**

- **Issue**: Sync engine had no concept of authenticated users
- **Fix**:
  - Added `setUserId()` method to sync engine
  - Integrated with authentication system via `useGetCurrentUser()` hook
  - Added automatic user data cleanup on logout

### 6. **Enhanced Sync Provider**

- **Issue**: Sync provider wasn't connected to user authentication
- **Fix**:
  - Integrated `useGetCurrentUser()` hook
  - Automatic user ID updates when auth state changes
  - Automatic data cleanup when user logs out

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Security Fixes:

- `convex/splits.ts` - Removed insecure queries, added authentication
- `lib/db/sync-engine.ts` - Updated to use secure queries, added user context

### Provider Updates:

- `providers/sync-provider.tsx` - Added user authentication integration
- `hooks/use-sync.ts` - Enhanced with user context (already properly designed)

### New Components:

- `components/sync/sync-test.tsx` - Test component to verify sync functionality

## üõ°Ô∏è Current Security Model

| Operation              | Access Control                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **View Public Split**  | ‚úÖ Anyone (no auth needed)      |
| **View Private Split** | ‚úÖ Creator only (auth required) |
| **Create Split**       | ‚úÖ Authenticated users only     |
| **Update Split**       | ‚úÖ Creator only                 |
| **Delete Split**       | ‚úÖ Creator only                 |
| **List User's Splits** | ‚úÖ User's own splits only       |
| **Sync Operations**    | ‚úÖ User's own data only         |

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. **Basic Usage**

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const { syncEngine, currentUser } = useSync();
  const { splits, createSplit, updateSplit } = useSplits(
    syncEngine,
    currentUser?.id
  );

  // All operations are now secure and user-scoped
}
```

### 2. **Testing**

- Add `<SyncTestComponent />` to any page to test sync functionality
- Verify splits are only visible to their creators
- Test offline functionality and sync indicators

### 3. **Production Deployment**

- All security measures are in place
- Sync engine works with both public and private splits
- Automatic user data isolation and cleanup

## ‚úÖ Security Checklist

- [x] No global data access (removed insecure `get` query)
- [x] Proper authentication on all mutations
- [x] User data isolation (users only see their own data)
- [x] Public/private split access control
- [x] Sync engine respects user permissions
- [x] Automatic cleanup on logout
- [x] Input validation (createdBy must match authenticated user)
- [x] Authorization checks (only owners can modify their splits)

## üîç Testing Scenarios

1. **Authenticated User**:

   - Can create, update, delete their own splits
   - Can view their own private splits
   - Can view any public split
   - Cannot modify other users' splits

2. **Unauthenticated User**:

   - Can view public splits only
   - Cannot perform any mutations
   - Cannot access private splits

3. **Sync Functionality**:
   - Only syncs user's own data
   - Respects online/offline status
   - Handles conflicts appropriately
   - Shows proper sync indicators

The sync engine is now secure, performant, and ready for production use!
